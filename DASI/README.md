README
==================

In order to view the HTML of the DASI project some steps are required. As of the day of this writing, GitHub does not allow large HTML files to be rendered on their website. To circumvent this restriction first do a right-click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasschmidtc/Coursera/master/DASI/dasi_project_gss_1972_2012.html) and save the HTML file to your desktop (or do a right-click on "View Raw" from [here](https://github.com/lucasschmidtc/Coursera/blob/master/DASI/dasi_project_gss_1972_2012.html)). Once the file is on your desktop, make sure it has the .html extension (in Mac OS X the file has probably been renamed to include a .txt extension, just remove it). Now, just open it in your browser.
